	<h3>How Damon Acts</h3>
	<p>Damon is a very passionate guy who doesn't let anyone get in the way of him. When he loves someone
	he loves hard. He has a very distinct personality and is very protective of what he loves. He is definently
	a romantic and he is sometimes described to be sinister, dangerous, generally unkind, uncaring, cold hearted, ruthless and unsympathetic.
	But to me I see him only act like that with people he really doesn't like. He can actually be a very good guy and can sometimes have a 
	good heart. Hes very good with his brother who he loves very much and would do anything for. </p>
	<h4>How Damon's Relationship with his Brother is</h4>
	<p> Damon and his brother share a very special relationship considering they have both been vampires for an extremely long time
	together. They have both been through so much including many ups and downs. Sometimes they would go decades without eachother
	because they could and they got mad with eachother. Other times they can be inseperable but overall at the end of the day they
	always forgave eachother and were there for eachother. They had a great brother bond.</p>
